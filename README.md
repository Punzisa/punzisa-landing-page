Inside this Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```

â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/

â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Brief.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Customer.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Footer.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Header.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Hero.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ about.astro
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro

â”‚       â””â”€â”€ terms_and_conditions.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
